# Web-Scraper

A web scraper used to parse data from a website containing in-game loot codes for a popular video game

Tech used: Python, Beautiful Soup library, Twilio library

The program utilizes the Beautiful Soup library to parse a website containing codes for a popular video game. The user can use these codes to get free in-game loot. Codes are released randomly and expire quickly. The program informs the user if new codes have been released, so they do not have to continuously check the website.
